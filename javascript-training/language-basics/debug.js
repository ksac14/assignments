/* Debugging Process
=============== */
//debugging in javascript
//Debugging is a process of executing the program manually to identify the errors and to resolve the issues whenever there is any failure during the execution process.
console.log("Executing Line 1");
console.log("Executing Line 2");
console.log("Executing Line 3");
sumOfNumbers(5, 10);
console.log("Executing Line 5");
console.log("Executing Line 6");
console.log("Executing Line 7");
console.log("Executing Line 8");
console.log("Executing Line 9");
console.log("Executing Line 10");

// Debugging the program step by step in Visual Studio Code

//1. Add the break point before the line where you are getting the error (Click on the line number where you want to manually start the execution. )
//2. Run the program in debug mode.


// continue (f5) : Continue the auto execution till the next breakpoint.
// stop (shift+f5) : Stop the debugging session.
// restart (ctrl+shift+f5) : Restart the debugging session.

// step over (f10) : Execute the current line and move to the next line.
// step into (f11) : Go inside the step to understand the background logic.
// step out (shift+f11) : Complete the execution of background logic and go back to the main program.
